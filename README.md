# Nano Plugin System
This is my very, very bad attempt at making a basic plugin system for nano,
that doesn't a million and one changes to make work! I'm also going to be
working on this in Nim, too which will be a challenge to integrate both
efficiently!

Please read the original README of the project! It can be found here:
